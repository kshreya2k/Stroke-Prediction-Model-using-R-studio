# Stroke-Prediction-Model-using-R-studio
Coursera certified stroke prediction model using R programming

# Build and deploy a stroke prediction model using R
### Project scenario
A leading healthcare organization wants to predict the likelihood of a patient getting a stroke based on their medical history and demographic information. As a data scientist, you're responsible for building a well-validated stroke prediction model using patient characteristics. Your task will include loading, cleaning, processing, analyzing, visualizing data, and building and deploying the prediction model for clinical use. The model will help the organization mitigate the growing problem of strokes and improve patient outcomes.
